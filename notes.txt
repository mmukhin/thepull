### Ideas

make available as podcast (ben); make lil videos; find distribution channels
From sid: what sales motion vs. what monthly revenue; knowing yourself (focusing on your strengths, gaining confidence; while improving your weaknesses or getting help)

Todo write
VA vs automate for idea evaluation (why not build that new tool; why panelfox works.. How to evaluate via hours * $)

Ground truth
My goal is to empower others, who feel a pull, for them to observe it, and follow what pulls them (what they’re interested in naturally), and work towards getting paid for it (or just getting fulfillment/bliss from it)



Roadblocks (via Rob book) - no market, fear, lack of goals, inconsistency
Realizations
Technician -> entrepreneur
Market Comes First, Marketing Second, Aesthetic Third, and Functionality a Distant Fourth
Mental hygiene
Pick yourself back up
“Process is king” (via rob)        
Market Comes First...
The product with a sizable market and low competition wins even with bad marketing, a bad aesthetic, and poor functionality. Think QuickBooks, Palm, or IE 5.5. You can sell garbage to a hungry market and make money. However, it’s not a sustainable strategy.
