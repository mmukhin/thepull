Ground truth
My goal is to empower others, who feel a pull, for them to observe it, and follow what pulls them (what they’re interested in naturally), and work towards getting paid for it (or just getting fulfillment/bliss from it)

The premise
- You’re a software engineer, or you’re learning to be one
- You feel a pull towards “making” something, it’s more important than a “job” (the pulls are tied to specific interests, or to helping others/creating value for other people; interests can evolve over time, but the feeling of a pull is usually there)
- This is your first try, or you’ve started different things a handful of times, and you don’t quite know how to pull it off, primarily from a business sense
- B2B focus

5 points
Feel the pull, and use it’s energy
If you’ve never done it or never seen anyone do it, i suggest make that a priority
Either if you want to create value for the world, or make money (which is a way to transfer value)... you better be fucking making something that is actually valuable to someone
This is a sliding scale, not black or white. Their pain and your solution will dictate where on that sliding scale your product will fall.
find/develop a reproducible sales channel
Be mindful of how much time you spend on coding vs sales/marketing/business
Always bring ideas and solutions back to the problem space
Stay consistent, see how you’re doing on the “business front”

Running a business solo vs w/ contractors/founders. I spend 20% on sales, 30% on support, 30% on development, and a miscellaneous 20%

Roadblocks (via Rob book) - no market, fear, lack of goals, inconsistency
Realizations
Technician -> entrepreneur
Market Comes First, Marketing Second, Aesthetic Third, and Functionality a Distant Fourth
Mental hygiene
Pick yourself back up
“Process is king” (via rob)        
Market Comes First...
The product with a sizable market and low competition wins even with bad marketing, a bad aesthetic, and poor functionality. Think QuickBooks, Palm, or IE 5.5. You can sell garbage to a hungry market and make money. However, it’s not a sustainable strategy.
