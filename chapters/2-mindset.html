Why do you want to do this? How can you be mindful of your current skills and tendencies, and mesh them into the goal you want to achieve?

Since this is not easy, the expectation you can have early on would be of “this didn’t work, but my goal is so important to me, that I will continue making progress, even if I don’t feel like it”.

If you’ve started projects before, or if this is your first rodeo - know yourself. I had a tendency to go straight to coding, which increased my risk of failure.




Follow a process; keep going, even if its hard; maintain a personal wins document; 
Main statement to take away
I know you can do it, because others have done it. What’s separating you from your definition of success is knowing the right things to do, and doing them consistently. There are so many moments in my early startup, that i was like “why am I even doing this, nothing is working yet”. This would happen every day when i was sending cold emails. I kept doubting myself, well because its t true, ive never doen this before, ive never tasted what its loike to get this to really work. I wasn’t sure if I was doing the right things, but i’m pretty sure I was.
It’s likely you will have doubt, because its likely that the things you do today won’t yield the results until a month or six months from now. This is a bit different from coding, where I feel instant (i can feel) instant gratification, the feedback cycle is addictive. With sales, i’ve found it to be (rewards) to be much more latent. I’ve noticed that, looking back, my consistent work over two months, yielded most of my customers for the next year. The time ranges are much different. Be mindful of this, don’t allow “im not seeing results immediately” to cloud your judgement. 
“We must train our minds to desire what the situation demands”
“Those who hope for good fortune, rarely deserve it”
“The less we deserve good fortune, the more we hope for it.”


Intro “story” to empathize, feel, entertain
If you’ve never seen anyone do this in person, find someone. Sometimes our beliefs are limited by our environment, so change your environment, and change your beliefs.
# Don’t give up, one of the main things is consistency (resilience;therapy;etc)
- I believe in you, if you feel a pull; just follow it
- There are many problems to test; there are many solutions to build to solve the problems efficiently
- It will likely take you at least 3 attempts to get something “right”, so bake that into your “grit”
    - Grant yourself at least 3 “failures”, so make a list of the solutions you want to test, and which solutions you think are best
    - If the first one does not work, you already have the next one to try, and so on
- I have felt like not doing something will cause more pain in the long run, than doing something
# Things like this take time; expect to work on this for months
- Stay consistent, and some features will take a day, some will take a week, some will take a couple weeks
- This is normal
