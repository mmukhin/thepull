# Outcomes, humans and our tools

(problem x market)

Takeaway question: If your product does not solve a need/problem, what is the chance that someone will pay for it? What outcome do they want? Be part of a community/interview 1:1.
Story
How to do it

As a developer, when I encounter some pain point, I’m often enticed to code up a solution. Mostly because I love to code, and it feeds my confidence and happiness. This is great when we solve our own problems. When we start applying this type of thinking to business, exercising caution is important.

Could this problem be solved by a VA in N hours?

^ whether or not someone is willing to pay you is related to this hours trade-off
In the case of Mailchimp, surveymonkey, etc - without these tools you WOULDN’T be able to get paid for the outcome you offer. Or you’d be losing money (thought of it in more real terms, you couldn’t be relied on to make a shoe for someone who wanted to trade you their harvest).

For some reason, you want to go into a specific business.
You know that other people/businesses would pay you for an outcome.
Someone needs some outcome (and is willing to pay up to $N to get it)
You can deliver their outcome
You can deliver an outcome without a monetary loss
You can deliver an outcome at a monetary gain

You need to find 10 specific types of people every week (can’t be re-used), to show up for research interviews. There is some max amount of money people are willing to pay you to do something (they make this judgment).

You also likely need some minimum wage.


In order for your project to support you financially, someone has to give you money for using it. If you want this work to support you (or your family) financially, people have to pay you for using the product. If you can’t imagine someone paying you for your software, you can either keep thinking of when they would pay for it, or move on to another problem.

For example, you could decide you want to help businesses keep track of their customers, customer contracts, leads, and people doing trials. This problem is solved by using a “Sales CRM” tool. There are concrete examples of people and businesses paying to use a CRM like Salesforce. It’s a guarantee that a market (people already spending money) exists to solve this problem. You could solve the problem of getting in touch with a large audience of people, what are some existing tools - churches, radio stations, websites, email newsletter products. There are plenty of people in the world who are currently spending money on a way to send a pretty mass email to a list of contacts. There are plenty of people who pay for Mailchimp. The competition is tough though, to get someone to choose YOUR product is the difficult part.


You have to (1) solve a problem/need, (2) for an audience. For example, if you wanted to start an e-commerce store selling Star Wars (or Star Trek) shirts, what needs would you have?

. You could start with an idea, but it's much better to have that idea be tied to a concrete problem; a problem real businesses have; let’s say at least 10 businesses.



Intro “story” to empathize, feel, entertain


[fear] Focus on solutions instead of problems. There is a higher margin of error for failure via “building a product that won’t generate revenue”. Omfg ive made this problem so many times.. Because I love coding not selling.
[hope] When i try to teach “Start with the problem” or “go to the root problem”, this chapter is important because its how value gets transferred (e.g. via money; or products or services).  (or another way to look at “sales”) / VALUE / don’t build stuff nobody wants
Image of someone in a market place selling something nobody wants
Image of someone in a marketplace selling something people want
- 1 humans need water and food
- 100 humans need dwelling
- 10,000 humans need lawyers
- 1,000,000 humans living together need
- Where do you come in? You make something more efficient (i.e. more productive)
- Next level thinking:
    - If you have cash flow, you are able to “free up” time for yourself
[fear] I spent 2 months building a cool product. Nobody showed up. I didnt want to spend any money on “marketing”, what the fuck is marketing anyway. Sales is a dirty word that I will never, ever, get involved with. I feel shitty because i wasted 2 months, and “quit” on the project.
[hope] Supply & demand. You must have demand
Via rob’s book “That something can be dry cleaning services, invoicing software, or hosted salesforce automation. What matters is finding a group of people who need your something more than they need the money you’re charging for it.”
Via rob, this illustrates the table well “As a self-funded startup you want a market that is already looking for your product, even if it doesn‟t exist.”
[info] # How do human societies improve (note: this has not been worked on at all)
- tldr; someone invented a hammer, and because building a house with a rock (instead of a hammer) sucked, someone saw the efficiency in this, and chose to spend $ to buy a hammer, to achieve a better outcome for themselves, instead of finding a new rock by the river (which was free)
- our apps are the same thing
Niches via rob “Building a general purpose, small-business, online accounting application is a really bad idea for a self-funded startup. For one, you won’t have the development or marketing resources to compete with the likes of Freshbooks, Blinksale, and BillMyClients. In addition, you won’t be able to keep up with support or feature implementation for that many general purpose business clients.”
- It’s “ok” to start from an “idea”, but BE CAREFUL. Ensure the “idea” solves a crucial pain point, and there are enough people in the world who would pay you to solve it; and that you would be happy if some % of those people did
Pros
you likely know about this solution space or problem space
        - You care about it more
    - Cons
        - You can be building for 0 interested people, because its not a bad enough problem
    - Best practices
        - go deep on problem space, understand the root problem, and the related problems
        - understand the existing solutions; understand where they are great, where they are good, where they are bad
- Do customer development (e.g. the mom test, lean startup, steve blank’s book); proper generative research
    - see them do the task in front of you
# competitors / existing solutions
How are your customers solving their problems today?
Who are the existing solutions in the space? Are they really good and growing, or are they not so good
Ask why - is it a shrinking market? Could be ok for you if the market is big enough for your goals
If there are no existing solutions in the space, this could be dangerous
You can either start with a problem space you’re interested in, or an audience you think you can distribute to.
# Instead of “sales” think of it as “value delivery”

Viability
Has product idea
Validated problem?
Will at least 1 person pay you for this?
Validated business? Will enough people pay you to use this tool, compared to what it costs to run the business?
Is there a big enough market for you to do this? 
Enougth potential customers
willing/Paying enough money





















Don’t have a problem or
Don’t know they have problem
Using current tools is satisfactory




Know they have problem, don’t know about solutions
Using current tools is unsatisfactory, don’t know about other solutions




Know they have problem, actively looking to solve it
Using current tools is unsatisfactory, actively looking for new tools









Context

Sliding scale




Have you started coding already? Wait, wait, wait, wait!

The next essay is about distributing your product, which means roughly "finding a repeatable way to sell your product". If you can find some buying "signal" which, once detected, you can contact this prospect and know exactly what to say to close the deal - this is the goal.
