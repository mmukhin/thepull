# Intro
If you love to code, and love to start new projects, and want to spend your days getting paid to do what you love.. this is roughly how I did it. 

These essays are my best attempts to clarify how to approach starting and running a SaaS business, from the perspective of a software engineer. When my work is aligned with my natural interests, it would be something I’d feel happy to do for free.

I didn’t dream of building the coolest and biggest company possible, I didn’t dream of raising VC money. I dreamed of working on a product I cared about, which truly helped some people in the world, and brought in enough revenue to be a 1-10 person business. I also love to work and collaborate with good people.

Also, this was a long term goal, a mindset I tried to cultivate. And I honestly didn't realize the type of work it would take to run a business as a founder. It didn’t work on my first few projects. Then I also joined a startup as CTO (define that how you may, i just coded every day).

Follow that curiosity, allow it to pull you, find the ways in which it pulls you, so that its less “effort” on your part, and it's more of “riding a wave”. I don’t know why I feel it, but I do, and I let it happen and energize me.

## The premise
- You’re a software engineer, or you’re learning to be one
- You feel a pull towards “making” something, like a product or a business or solving a problem, it’s more important than a “job” (the pull is tied to specific interests, or to helping others/creating value for other people; interests can evolve over time, but the feeling of a pull is usually there)
- This is your first try, or you’ve started different things a handful of times but they haven't met your mark of success, primarily from a business sense

## 5 points
- Feel the pull, and use it’s energy
- If you’ve never done it or never seen anyone do it, i suggest make that a priority
- Either if you want to create value for the world, or make money (which is a way to transfer value)... you better be fucking making something that is actually valuable to someone
- This is a sliding scale, not black or white. Their pain and your solution will dictate where on that sliding scale your product will fall.
- find/develop a reproducible sales channel
- Be mindful of how much time you spend on coding vs sales/marketing/business
- Always bring ideas and solutions back to the problem space
- Stay consistent, see how you’re doing on the “business front”

## My experience
- Joined startup Boomrat as lead engineer, sold to Live Nation
- Co-founded Metapop as CTO, sold to Native Instruments
- Founded Panelfox, profitable SaaS

## What my day to day looks like
Running a business solo vs w/ contractors/founders. I spend 20% on sales, 30% on support, 30% on development, and a miscellaneous 20%
