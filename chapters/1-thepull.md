# Where I began

One Monday morning in my early 20s, I walked into my work’s kitchen and saw a colleague who looked like showing up to work today was the last thing he wanted to do with his life. I felt an immediate reaction. I did not want this to be my future. My goal became figuring out how to get rid of the feeling of “going to my job every morning”, and instead spend my days working on “something I’d feel happy to do for free”. There are many options, and the key was to start getting to know myself, and to craft a life around it.

As a teenager, I was into gaming and played first person shooters. I got pretty into it, and decided to join a gaming team. To show the world how cool we were, we needed a website, so I taught myself some HTML. Oh, what a great way to design websites. After building the gaming site, I started picking up random gigs to make websites for others. I had fun coding, and I got paid for it - that’s pretty lucky. Throughout my teenage years I often felt an urge to create things online (websites, tutorials, etc), which either solved a problem I had, or I thought could get some visitors. Seeing visitors to my site and tracking analytics was the greatest feeling in the world. My dream was, that after college I could gather enough experience to have some kind of app, or website, or online tool be something I’d do full time. I didn’t really think about money at the time, but I knew that it had to be valuable for people. I don’t know why I was inclined to make stuff, but it felt like it was pulling me in. No effort had to be exerted.

I imagine this pull as an available energy resource, as if I was riding downhill on a bicycle. It’s somehow inexhaustible, there is no strain, just a flow. What easier way to live your life, than to exert no energy in pursuit of a goal? (To be truthful, the full list of work required to run a software company can extend outside of this “natural pull”, but using “the pull” as fuel helped me do the other stuff.) I view this as nature speaking to me, or myself observing nature within me, getting out of the way, and riding the wave.

My first job out of college was at a web agency, I got a little bit of experience writing HTML, CSS and PHP for CMS websites - not that fun but it was ok. Then I got a job as a software engineer at a “startup” (of 200 people), which at the time felt like a big corporation. I learned a lot on the job. When I’d come home, I’d work on my own software projects, sometimes until 3am. I made websites that scraped music off blogs, and kept a few other projects. I had a software blog with some tutorials, and created a few small open source projects on GitHub. At my day job, after a year or so, my interest waned. The idea of spending my time working on someone else’s ideas, that I didn’t care about, made me feel like a computer instead of a human. It felt like a job.

I went on to be a lead dev at a startup - so much ownership!!! Talk about this more. Coding my own projects makes me really happy, time flies by as I’m deep in code, and I wanted to spend my days maximizing this. Luckily one time I got introduced to a business-minded founder, and we started a company together. I was able to code all day, working on a project in the music space. I was interested in the industry, and (surprising to myself) would come into work excited. And I worked for free for 1 year, until I couldn’t pay rent (I did have founder equity in the company). 

When I was starting out as an engineer, sales was such a foreign, and slimy concept for me. I would rather have died than had the words “Enterprise software” come out of my mouth. I have an idea that I think would be cool, it just came to me one day, and I’m going to start coding - do not do this. If I build the thing, somehow people will just find it, and that will be that. Or I’ll just figure out the sales / audience building later - no no no no no. # Instead of “sales” think of it as “value delivery”

My desire to code up a tool overwhelmed my desire for creating a business. The primary difference is that a business should bring in money! What would typically happen is I’d get excited about some idea I had - it would be evaluated lightly but I’d usually go straight to coding. I wouldn’t think about how much I could realistically charge for this, I didn’t deeply consider if people in the world are currently spending money to solve this problem. If I did consider that, that was a step forward, but then I wouldn’t consider how I would distribute the product - why would someone give ME money instead of another company?

These were painful learning experiences, I would dedicate weeks, or months, to projects - then I’d wonder why nobody is signing up to pay me! I didnt want to spend any money on “marketing”, what the fuck is marketing anyway. Sales is a dirty word that I will never, ever, get involved with. I feel shitty because i wasted 2 months, and “quit” on the project

Projects I’ve built in the past
- Sender: Chrome extension for GMail to send mass emails
- NeverBored: “Things to do” app for Los Angeles
- (Forgot name): App that allowed you to discover what people are listening to in your neighborhood (or the world)
- InitPresets: A marketplace to buy and sell sounds for professional musicians


I felt like the pain in the long run (over my life) of not doing something, will be far worse than the short term pain of just trying to take the next step. - Said another way, I felt like not doing something will cause more pain in the long run, than the pain-less (but shameful) act of doing nothing.

[hope] I know you can, and will achieve your goals. If you have never seen someone achieve a goal like this, YOUR FIRST TASK IS TO FIND A PERSON THAT HAS, so you can see and believe that this is possible.

Have you started coding already? Wait, wait, wait, wait!

If I had one piece of advice for myself (or rather, a wish for more self-discipline) - it would be to stop coding, and define how the thing you're coding is going to make money. Then, try to validate that someone will actually pay you this money. I've been caught in the trap of "oh I'll figure out how to get someone to pay me after my product is done" - and its much much harder to do this later, because there's a chance you didn't build the right product that someone would pay you for. Or there's a chance the market is so competitive, you can't get your voice heard, so nobody buys your product. Try your damn hardest to get as close to hearing "here's my credit card number, I want this product tomorrow". In this case, code and don't stop coding, listen to your customer's feedback, and iterate, iterate, iterate. Then repeat the same sales process to get more customers.

Who is going to buy from you, what outcome are they going to buy from you, and why?

A successful answer is:
- **Who:** Qualitative research recruitment companies who have at least 3 employees, running at least 3 projects per month, who are currently using different tools to accomplish their outcome
- **Outcome:** Their business is to deliver highly qualified research participants as fast as possible, while keeping margins as large as possible
- **Why:** They will buy a solution that allows them to improve their outcome, primarily they will be able to deliver the same high quality respondents faster (increasing their client’s satisfaction) which will increase their margins because they will be working less hours (but charging their clients the same amount); the solution will also automatically do things for them they have been ignoring (that would have previously cost them money). In all, the solution will cost them $1000/month; their current cost is $30/hr * 5 * 5 * 4 = $3,000
