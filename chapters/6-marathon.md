Once you have some market pull, or if there’s hope someone is interested to pay - NOW is the time to iterate as fast as you possibly can. Elon’s quote “startup’s success is based on how fast you can respond to new information.”

# Don’t code too much
- If you really enjoy coding, design, its easy to spend too much time on this, INSTEAD of focusing on the business side
- Beta/paid/commit -> hand holding mvp
- Use open source, don’t build from scratch, focus on mixing your pleasure & business necessities

# If customers are too demanding or you don’t know if its possible… It’s likely possible, just try it bit by bit
- over a month or two, you’d be incredibly surprised that you did it

# Overcoming your own problems
- sometimes its a mental hurdle of wrong assumptions (explore the problem space to see what’s actually broken)

# with sales
- be persistent, people get busy, things fluctuate, keep following up until they say NO; but don’t be spammy; I’ve seen NOs turn into YES, but allow them to reach out

# Release as often as possible
- if its a new product, and you’ve set the expectation that its new, and you’re MANIACAL at customer support
    - Have gmail open in browser, so you can see unread count; have notifications on your phone
        - After a few months, you can scale this down, it caused me anxiety
    - Reply to emails within a minute.. for example “ah i just saw this error come through the logs, let me fix it asap and i will email you once its done”
    - If an error happens in the logs, make sure you have tracking set up to see who encountered it (and email them, saying “i know you may have seen an error, im fixing it now”)
- This builds incredible trust with your first customers, and theyre willing to

# Be maniacal about support
- understand why someone asked you for a feature, dont start building right away, ask them “please elaborate”; you basically want to make sure that their “solution request” is the best solution for the given problem; would other customers expect it to be solved differently?

Don’t get too carried away w eng; be aware of what’s important to actually have a business
Explain aws credits (via brex, mercury, etc)
My costs - remote eng/designer
Think of sales as “sharing your innovation” vs used car sales

End game - cash flow/business or sell (meet ceo before, see what’s inefficient)
