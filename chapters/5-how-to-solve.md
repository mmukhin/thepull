# How to solve problem (what to build)

If you’ve been doing the work to understand what outcomes a market segment wants, and what unmet needs they have, it should be easier to solve their problem (aka build the solution). In reality, these are not step by step problems, but iteration loops - iteration on your understanding of market needs, their current solutions, and your possible improved solutions.

It’s important that the pain point is frequent.

The initial prototype I built did not impress anyone. But future iterations left people in awe. Between these 2 events, I spent time working with people that had a real need in their work-life, the goal was to actually try to solve their problem well (and meet/exceed their expectations) in a real-life, “money on the line” scenario. 

I worked with a friend of mine who was a UXR, and defined the step-by-step outcomes he needed to get the outcome he needed. He used Google Drawings to show me the steps he took and the outcomes he was looking for. I turned these into “user story maps”, then created feature stories (and ranked them by the kano model). After a month or so of working on this, keeping in mind to spread my time across the user stories, so that I was constantly testing the full end-to-end outcome, and not just the start/middle/end of the flow. Everything had to connect as early as possible, even if individual parts were kinda shitty.

With the MR market segment, the first person I spoke with went on and on about her problems, and how overwhelmed she was. When I showed her my prototype, she was awe-struck.


Question takeaway: How to solve a problem well enough so that people will pay you?

Solution takeaway: You must know the outcome your potential customers want, and you can either improve an existing (competing) product, or you can start from first principles to get your customer the outcome they want. With either approach, lay out how people are getting to their desired outcome today via “jobs to be done”/”user story maps” (it may be 3 - 10 steps).

Vs competitors:
Better User Experience
Colors, buttons, simplicity (intuitiveness of what to do)
Ease of use (getting from start to finish faster)
Getting more done in one tool (less context switching)
Cheaper

Pillars
First version should provide desirable outcome
Since you’ve been in touch with potential customers.. Build with them
Develop close relationship with the person, be empathetic, you’re trying to solve a problem in their live (if you’re not doing this for this reason, its a nice reason)
# MVP (maybe don’t use Jargon, if you do people might already think they know, and glaze over it)
- kano: must-have, intermediates, delighters
- user story mapping / jtbd
- build alongside at least 1 person
- try to have them use it for real projects in their business
- try to have them commit to pay you (sign contract)
- have them pre-pay you before you even start coding
Design
- As simple as possible (in marketplace you’re selling magical efficiency, not completely; problems disappear).. clone/refer to another b2b site design/ux
clone an existing site, use different color palette, font

Goal: Deliver unquestionable value, this is the reason someone would be willing to pay for your solution. Your solution will get them from A to B faster, cheaper, or better.

Through your initial market conversations, you should have observed what your customers need, and where the unmet needs are.

Some existing frameworks I like to use have been user story mapping or JTBD. Then you can segment each vertical by the kano model (must-have, intermediates, delighters)

Provide incredible support.
