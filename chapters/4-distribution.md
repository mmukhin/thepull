# For whom? (sales/distribution channel)

Takeaway question: If you can’t find N people willing to pay for your solution, what is the chance?

How to set pricing? What is the specific slice of the market you can sell to, and what’s a signal you see that they’re more likely to buy?

You need to be speaking with individuals, you need to observe their actual behaviors (what they actually do vs. what they say they want to do), and you need to be observing communities.

OUTCOME
Market/willingness to buy
Market segment / niche 
Jobs to be done / workflows
Current Solutions to meet the Outcome / Products
Can you find a (repeatable) signal that someone is facing a pain point that YOU can solve? How will you reach your audience?
Why will someone choose to pay you?
Get insights and data for knowledge / decision making by finding people and asking them questions 
Yes, there are existing solutions in the space, which companies are paying for
A service business which can find the right people to participate in your research project, primarily using their own list of contacts
You need to deliver a scheduled list of people to your client. You need to vet the people. You need to pay the people. You need to originally find the best people. You may be doing 5-10 projects in parallel. You can either have your own list of contacts, or find new people for every study.

Self-solved pain point
Very low cost, but as the business grows, it takes more time to do tasks. The market CAN deliver a more efficient tool
Panelfox
Found companies that self-solved the issue, but are facing growing pains

Cold email
Our tool is very easy to use, but it is missing some important features
ARCS
Cold email
Conferences
Very powerful, but not very easy to use and to learn (time and effort it takes to get outcome can be cut down)

Main statement to take away
- there are so many “important” things, but finding a repeatable distribution channel for the specific problem you solve, is like fucking gold
Via rob, this illustrates the table well “As a self-funded startup you want a market that is already looking for your product, even if it doesn‟t exist.”
[MUST-HAVE] Market segment (niche) and their problem that they're willing to pay for
 |
 v
[GREAT-TO-HAVE] Repeatable distributon channel (how will you sell, ideally via process)
 |
 v
[ONLY USEFUL IF YOU HAVE #1] Your solution/value proposition/product that improves their lives measurably; # overall.. deliver EXTRA/unquestionable value

Intro “story” to empathize, feel, entertain
[hope] When I was in high school, and just starting out, I got a lot of joy out of website visitors (That was my “currency” at the time.). So I worked backwards from “how can I get a lot of website visitors”. I was a fan of photoshop, and had found a website which had high traffic, and acted as a directory of photoshop tutorials. They would post a new batch of tutorials every day, and if your website was on that list, you’d get a bunch of traffic. This is an example of finding an audience first (people looking to solve a problem or fill a need), then providing a compelling product or solution.
In my teens, I built a website, and would make photoshop tutorials, submit them to tutorial directories, and get the pleasure of traffic to my website. I loved that.
[hope] In the case of Panelfox, I noticed that a company I spoke with had a business Facebook profile, and they would post links to SurveyMonkey surveys, with a description of the research study and potential compensation. I thought this was interesting, and wondered if there were other businesses similar to the first. There were! This was important, because my tool would replace surveymonkey and mailchimp, so this was an insight into an active business using these 2 tools to run their operations.
# overall.. deliver EXTRA/unquestionable value
[trudge; keep going] # Start w problem & audience (who you can distribute to, to make some monthly revenue)
- Important: the problem should to be severe & frequent
- I spoke with 20+ customers in 1 market segment, but there was not much of a pull… and i stumbled upon another market segment
- arvind khal / rob walling -> focus on a niche
- Charge enough- b2b is easier to price/charge more
consumers are much flakier, and less likely to spend money, because the ROI is not as apparent
- Do customer development (e.g. the mom test, lean startup, steve blank’s book); proper generative research
    - see them do the task in front of you
# competitors / existing solutions
How are your customers solving their problems today?
Who are the existing solutions in the space? Are they really good and growing, or are they not so good
Ask why - is it a shrinking market? Could be ok for you if the market is big enough for your goals
If there are no existing solutions in the space, this could be dangerous
Test both the problem and the distribution channel
# Find and test the problem
- Don’t believe problem exists; they are fully happy and satisfied
- Are they aware of their problem? No. They feel pain, but they don’t know its a problem.
- Are they aware of their problem? Yes. They feel pain, and they wish to solve it, but don’t know how.
- Are they aware of their problem? Yes. They know there are solutions out there, they’re comparing the solutions.
